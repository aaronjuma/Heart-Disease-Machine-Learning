## [Try it out](https://aaronjuma-heart-disease-machine-learning-webpage-hxl1q0.streamlit.app/)

This is a website that could determine user's probability of having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) base on their health status.
We have trained a model based on the dataset avaliable on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) 


### Future Goals
---
1. We hope to add more functionality later on the website to provide other models to predict more different kind of heart diseases.
