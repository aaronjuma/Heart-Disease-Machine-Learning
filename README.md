Created by: Aaron, Wallace

This is a website that could determine user's probability of having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) base on their health status.
We have trained a model based on the dataset avaliable on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
